      <h4>Common Cold</h4>
      <p>
        A cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper
        airways. It's very common and usually clears up on its own within a week
        or two. The main symptoms of a cold include sore throat, blocked or
        runny nose, sneezing, and cough. More severe symptoms, including a high
        temperature (fever), headache and aching muscles can also occur,
        although these tend to be associated more with flu. There's no cure for
        a cold, but you can look after yourself at home by resting, drinking
        plenty of fluids and eating healthily.

      <h4>Sinusitis</h4>
      <p>
        Sinusitis is a common condition in which the lining of the sinuses
        becomes inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and often
        improves within two or three weeks. The mucus produced by your sinuses
        usually drains into your nose through small channels. In sinusitis,
        these channels become blocked because the sinus linings are inflamed
        (swollen).Symptoms of sinusitis include pain and tenderness around your
        cheeks, eyes or forehead, a blocked nose, toothache, a reduced sense of
        smell, a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, and bad
        breath. You can help relieve your symptoms by regularly cleaning the
        inside of your nose with a saline solution – you can make this at home
        yourself or use sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy and
        holding warm packs to your face

      <h4>Conjunctivitis</h4>
      <p>
        Conjunctivitis is a common condition that causes redness and
        inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the
        eye (the conjunctiva). People often refer to conjunctivitis as red
        eye.Other symptoms of conjunctivitis include itchiness and watering of
        the eyes, and sometimes a sticky coating on the eyelashes (if it's
        caused by an allergy). Conjunctivitis can affect one eye at first, but
        usually affects both eyes after a few hours. In severe cases, antibiotic
        eye drops can be used to clear the infection. Allergic conjunctivitis
        can usually be treated with anti-allergy medications such as
        antihistamines. If possible, you should avoid the substance that
        triggered the allergy.It's best not to wear contact lenses until the
        symptoms have cleared up. Any sticky or crusty coating on the eyelids or
        lashes can be cleansed with cotton wool and water. Washing your hands
        regularly and not sharing pillows or towels will help prevent it
        spreading

      <h4>Cold and Flu</h4>
      <p>
        Colds and influenza (flu) are the most common illnesses among college
        students in general. Both illnesses are upper respiratory infections,
        meaning they involve your nose, throat, and lungs. Most transmission of
        these viruses occurs via hand-to-hand contact. Flu symptoms come on
        suddenly and affect the body all over. Flu symptoms are usually more
        serious than a cold and include headache, more intense pain and fatigue
        or often dry cough. When you get the flu, you are also more prone to
        bronchitis, sinus, and ear infections. Cold symptoms mostly affect above
        the neck and include cough, sneezing or runny nose etc. For treatment,
        resting more than usual and avoid exercise until symptoms are gone,
        drinking lots of clear liquid such as water, tea. Staying away from
        cigarette smoke is preferred as well.

    <div class="card-wrapper">
      <h4>Allergies</h4>
      <p>
        Allergies are an immune response triggered by allergens, an ordinarily
        harmful substance. Common allergens may include foods, pollen, mold,
        latex, pet dander. Since there are various types of allergies, there are
        so many possible of symptoms such as runny nose, stuffy nose, eye
        irrigation, etc. The easiest and most effective way to treat allergies
        is to get rid of or avoid the cause. Where unavoidable, some lifestyle
        changes can reduce your allergy symptoms. For example, if you are
        allergic to dust mites, try to keep your room clean and free of dust by
        frequent vacuuming, dusting, and washing of bedding. For pollen
        allergies, avoid being outside when pollen counts are high and keep the
        windows to your room shut.

      <h4>Headaches</h4>
      <p>
        Headache is pain in any region of the head. Headaches may occur on one
        or both sides of the head, be isolated to a certain location, radiate
        across the head from one point, or have a viselike quality. A headache
        may appear as a sharp pain, a throbbing sensation, or a dull ache. As a
        treatment, sleeping or at least resting is required. Taking breaks from
        stressful situations, prescription drugs for severe headaches.

        (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed. The main
        symptom is a cough, which may bring up yellow-grey mucus (phlegm).
        Bronchitis may also cause a sore throat and wheezing. You only need to

<h4> Kidney Stones</h4> 

<p>
Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 
to 60.

developing them at some stage of their lives.
The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it's 
known as renal colic.
Symptoms of kidney stones
Small kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. But 
it's fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the: <ul> <li> feeling sick (nausea) </li> 
<li> ureter - the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder</li> 
<li> urethra - the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body </li>
